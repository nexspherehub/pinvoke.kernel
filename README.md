## üìò About the Kernel32 API

The **Kernel32** API constitutes a fundamental interface of the Windows operating system, providing essential
low-level functions for its operation. This API is responsible for critical operations, including, but not limited
to, memory management, thread and process manipulation, as well as control of input/output devices.

### Key Functionalities:

- **Memory Management**: Allocation and release of memory.
- **Process and Thread Manipulation**: Creation, control, and termination of processes and threads.
- **Device Control**: Handling of files, directories, and input/output devices.
- **Synchronization**: Implementation of synchronization functions, such as mutexes and events.

This API is indispensable for developers who require direct interaction with the core of the Windows
operating system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compiling the Library

To compile the library using [Visual Studio][visual_studio], it is recommended to select the **"Release"** mode.
If you choose to use a different IDE, it is advisable to consult the specific documentation for the
[.NET Framework][dotnet_framework] to appropriately configure your development environment.

## üì¶ Packaging the Library

To package the library, the use of the **`nuget`** terminal tool is essential, which can be obtained from the
official website or installed via WinGet (recommended option). After installation, navigate to the "NuGet"
directory and execute the command `nuget pack .` to initiate the packaging process.

> **Note**: It is crucial to compile the project before proceeding with the packaging.
